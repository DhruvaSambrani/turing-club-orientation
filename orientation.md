Convener: Aditya Jain
 
Co-Convener: Kaushik Gupta and Rajnil Mukherjee!
 
## Who are we

Turing Club is a group of students who feel that Computers are more than just tools to make PDFs.

We are people who code for science, for building the digital world and obviously for fun.

# Computation in Science

---

Computers have been extremely useful in Science. Physics, Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics... literally every subject has progressed in leaps and bounds with the advent of faster calculations, better visualisations and easier data.

## Last Year

- Our first Turing Week (A week where we host lots of events and workship for you to learn, tinker and enjoy!!)
  - Interesting talks with students and professors.
  - Treasure Hunt
  - Interactive Robotics workshop (with **Robotics Club obviously**)
  
- Fun Stuff
  - Date-A Programmer (with **Patang Club**)
  - Techtionary
