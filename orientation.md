We are people who code for science, for building the digital world and obviously for fun.

# Computers in Science

---

Computers have been extremely useful in Science. Physics, Bio, Chem Math... literally every subject has progressed in leaps and bounds with the advent of faster calculations, better visualisations and easier data.
